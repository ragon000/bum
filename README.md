`bum-urxvt` is a daemon that downloads album art for songs playing in `mpd`/`mopidy` and displays them as the background image of the `urxvt` terminal window it was started in. `bum-urxvt` doesn't loop on a timer, instead it waits for `mpd`/`mopidy` to send a `player` event. When it receives a `player` event it wakes up and downloads album art for the current playing track. This makes `bum-urxvt` lightweight and makes it idle at `~0%` CPU usage.

`bum-urxvt` uses [musicbrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/) to source and download cover art, if an album is missing it's cover art you can easily create an account and fill in the data yourself. `bum-urxvt` outputs (when the verbose option is set) a `release-id` which you can use to find the exact entry on musicbrainz.

Note: `bum-urxvt` is meant to be used with files that don't have embedded album art (`mopidy-spotify`).
